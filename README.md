imageSlider for Android

This is a prototype I developed and is not an Android App but a component that can be used in an Android App.

We are familiar with photos. And always find it pleasent when photos on the screen slide automatically one after another.

This is a prototype to slide images left to right which the system does automatically as per the time interval set in the code. It also has a graphic utility built that at the bottom shows at what image you are by highlighting the bullet point out of all images (Using ASCII code to show bullet points)

Whats awesome about it? It uses minimum resources and is custom built. I didn't used an inbuilt library to perform the operation.
